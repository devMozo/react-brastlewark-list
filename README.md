Listing of the Brastlewark's population.

Our team here at AXA is playing a fantasy role-playing game and every time the heroes they play arrive at a town, they have the issue they don't
know the local population and what they can do to help them on their adventures. This is one of these times, our heroes just arrived at a Gnome
town called Brastlewark. To facilitate trade with the local population they need an easy way to browse all the inhabitants details. We've found a server providing all the census data of Brastlewark at the following address:

Gnomes in this town are not really social because they have too much work to do. That's the reason they can have more than one job and might
have few or even no friends at all. They also appreciate their privacy so they've used some random images from internet, not specifically
optimized for mobile devices, for their profile. (They are very modern in some aspects and they have smartphones and access to internet for
instance).
